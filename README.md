To run app locally:

1. Fork and clone the project.
2. Run `npm run install` in the project root folder. If you wish to install and run only backend or frontend part of the app, then `cd` into that folder and run `npm install`. For example: `cd backend && npm install`.
3. Then to run app (from root folder) in dev mode: `npm run dev`. If you prefer to run backend in one terminal and frontend in another, then execute `npm run dev:backend` in one and `npm run dev:frontend` in another.
4. By default backend server is running on port 3001 and frontend on port 3000. So they are accessible at `http://localhost:3001` and `http://localhost:3000`.
